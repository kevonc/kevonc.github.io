        <p>With a lot of footage taken from my family trip in South Africa, I dedicated some time to select a matching song, review beats, and lay down the shots to build a storyline. It was my first time doing so, and it was without watching any video-making tutorial, just doing what I think other video makers do. I hope I at least get some parts right.</p>
