    <div class="post-content">
      
      <p>Back in March 2020, I was very active on my LinkedIn trying to engage my network.</p>

<p>Soon I realized the engagement numbers weren’t moving at all.</p>

<p>I spent some time looking at the best marketer I knew, Dave Gerhardt, and studied how he did it. And I learned that it all came down to copywriting skills - which I sucked at. I was determined to get that fixed.</p>

<h2 id="why-you-need-to-brush-up-your-copywriting">Why you need to brush up your copywriting</h2>

<p>When you look at the best influencers in the world and how they drive thousands, if not hundreds, of engagement, it is always: can you relate to people quickly?</p>

<p>Most of us are still used to the traditional form of communication - broadcast a message, people like it or leave it, and we carry on.</p>

<p>Then social media came along, and it became all about speaking directly to your audiences and have this two-way communication. Now, everyone is a marketing channel.</p>

<p>And the best form of communication is still text, believe it or not. That’s where copywriting comes in.</p>

<p>But a lot of us don’t take copywriting seriously because it is not easy to spot that you’re not good at it. As long as you can write, you can always produce something. But are people reading it? That’s the billion dollar question.</p>

<div class="content">
	<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Copywriting is the most underrated skill. Most people write so they think it’s not hard. There’s not an obvious technical barrier like with coding or oil painting, where you can’t do it and therefore realize there’s skill involved</p>&mdash; Wes Kao (@wes_kao) <a href="https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1328441465073229833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2 id="dave-gerhardts-copywriting-tactics-on-linkedin">Dave Gerhardt’s copywriting tactics on LinkedIn</h2>

<p>If you spend enough time in the marketing world, you must know Dave Gerhardt. He was the VP of Marketing at Drift and now CMO at Privy. He is amazing because he is very different from the other marketing leaders. And you know he is good by looking at his engagement metrics.</p>

<p>So, how does he write on LinkedIn?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>He writes like he talks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is talking to a very clear audience</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His opening line is very short (8-16 words)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He tells a story (even a personal one)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He shares users’ success stories</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He uses bullet points</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He focuses on one hashtag only</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He injects personality and talks about unrelated things</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He posts consistently</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He speaks the annoying truth</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lets-look-at-each-one-with-details">Let’s look at each one with details!</h2>

<h3 id="he-writes-like-he-talks">He writes like he talks</h3>

<p>To a lot of us, when we first write marketing copies, somehow we always go for a commercial, robotic type of tone as if that is the golden standard.</p>

<p>Dave doesn’t do that. When you read his words, you feel that he is talking to you like a friend on the phone.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/gerhardt-6-min.png" alt="" class="full-image" /></p>

<h3 id="he-is-talking-to-a-very-clear-audience">He is talking to a very clear audience</h3>

<p>We all get greedy and want to speak to a lot of people at once. Dave focuses on marketers and he makes it very clear. Funny enough, by doing this, he naturally attracts other people.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/gerhardt-1-min.png" alt="" class="full-image" /></p>

<h3 id="his-opening-line-is-short-8-16-words">His opening line is short (8-16 words)</h3>

<p>I love to look at his 1st line. The shorter (&lt;10 words), the better. Because no one gives a f about your writing so you only have the 1st line (likely 0.3 seconds) to get their attention.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/gerhardt-7-min.png" alt="" class="full-image" /></p>

<h3 id="he-tells-a-story-even-a-personal-one">He tells a story (even a personal one)</h3>

<p>We all love reading a story because we’re nosy and we want to find out what happened. Daves always writes as if he is telling a quick bedtime story to his kids.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/gerhardt-2-min.png" alt="" class="full-image" /></p>

<h3 id="he-uses-bullet-points">He uses bullet points</h3>

<p>No one has time, so let’s cut to the chase. Removing words is key in good copywriting.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/gerhardt-8-min.png" alt="" class="full-image" /></p>

<h3 id="he-focuses-on-one-hashtag-only">He focuses on one hashtag only</h3>

<p>Are you thinking of using hashtags to bring in views &amp; engagement? It is not quite sustainable and Dave doesn’t care about that. He is persistent on one hashtag only: #marketing.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/gerhardt-9-min.png" alt="" class="full-image" /></p>

<div class="subscription">
	<script async="" data-uid="c2f0551d65" src="https://kevon.ck.page/c2f0551d65/index.js"></script>
</div>

<h3 id="he-injects-personality-and-talks-about-unrelated-things">He injects personality and talks about unrelated things</h3>

<p>Big one. If copywriting is #1 important, personality is #2. Have some swags and differentiate yourself from the rest. Dave is genuine and fun, and you just want to be his friends.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/gerhardt-10-min.png" alt="" class="full-image" /></p>

<h3 id="he-posts-consistently">He posts consistently</h3>

<p>To keep an active presence, Dave tweets at least once a day, and posts on LinkedIn every other day if not everyday.</p>

<h3 id="he-speaks-the-annoying-truth">He speaks the annoying truth</h3>

<p>Here comes the best way to resonate with your audience - get on the same side! Dave points out annoying things he faces in his life/work and it feels like a friend telling you over lunch, so you jump into the conversation. 3,106 reactions and 723 comments!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/gerhardt-12-min.png" alt="" class="full-image" /></p>

<h2 id="bonus-writing-well-is-not-enough-on-linkedin">Bonus: writing well is not enough on LinkedIn</h2>

<p>This is not from Dave, but I must bring it up because I see quite a lot of people writing better yet still don’t get the engagement they want.</p>

<p>You want to dedicate time to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Remove irrelevant Linkedin connections</li>
  <li>Clean up your feed by “Unfollow XXX”</li>
  <li>Now you only see relevant connections &amp; your target audience</li>
  <li>Add or follow more target audience</li>
  <li>Interact with their posts genuinely</li>
</ol>

<p>By doing this consistently, you’ll start seeing results coming back to your posts.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-improved-my-engagement-results">How I improved my engagement results</h2>

<p>Obviously, here I’m only able to capture a small part of his mastermind. You’ll learn much more if you follow Dave’s <a href="https://twitter.com/davegerhardt" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davegerhardt/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>After I picked up these tactics from Dave. I put them into practice and saw my engagement numbers go up and up. Within 5 months, I was able to achieve 5-10x growth on my regular LinkedIn posts.</p>

<p>I hope these are helpful, and please share with me if you think there are more I should add to this article.</p>

<p>These days, I’m starting to write and share my learnings in product &amp; growth. If you enjoy this, I’d appreciate to hear from you so that I can improve. And of course, subscribe below if you want to hear from me again. Thanks!</p>
