<h2>Who</h2>
<p>Looking back to what I did when I was about 13 years old, I thought I was an abnormal kid. Instead of playing sports with friends after school, I spent all of my after-school hours on buying domains, configuring web hosting, studying the latest frameworks, and building websites. Fast forward to today when technology and software become the fuel to drive our world to improvement, suddenly having this knowledge is not so bad. I even regret giving up on it when I moved to Massachusetts for boarding school at 15 years old.</p>

<p>I go by the name Kevon. Since I graduated from <a href="http://www.babson.edu/" target="_blank">Babson College</a>, an entrepreneurship school, I've been working on things I'm passionate about. First I was working on a startup in Hong Kong, met a lot of people and learned a lot from the experience. Then I was working as a Software Engineer in Singapore, and now I'm with <a href="http://firstcodeacademy.com" target="_blank">First Code Academy</a>, empowering the next generation to become creators of technology. I only do what I enjoy and I have to say I'm lucky to be working on things I truly care about thus far.</p>

<h2>Why</h2>
<p>What I love about technology is the possibilities and flexibilities. You can code and create products and tools alone, or you can collaborate with others - anything is based on your own preference. Coding is also extremely mobile, you can be productive anytime anywhere. When I was young, I thought architect was cool; now I think being an architect (aka programmer) using the power of Internet is cooler.</p>

<h2>How</h2>
<p>I believe in hardwork, learning, and determination. I like to read, from personal development books, to startup stories, to interesting fictions (once in awhile to mix it up). I never understood the power of books until I started working at 22 years old when I realized there are so much knowledge out there! Being able to absorb them and apply to your own life is amazing. Another concept I live by is the 24-hour split - You have 24 hours a day, you spend 8 hours at work, and you spend 8 hours sleeping. The remaining 8 hours determine what kind of life you live. This changes my view on my daily routine.</p>
