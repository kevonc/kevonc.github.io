<h3>Kevon Cheung</h3>
<br>
<p>A lot of people started their entrepreneurial journeys since young, perhaps by selling candies or instant noodles to schoolmates. For me, I was never an entrepreneurial kid. I was quite the opposite, I was the kid who lived by boundaries. And then at some point in my teenage life, I became obsessed with the idea of creating, bringing true values to people, and having an impact on the world.</p>

<p>My passion for technology started at the age of 12 when I was tinkering on the Internet and built a number of websites that attracted hundreds of thousands of users. I then attended Babson College in the United States to major in Entrepreneurship & Finance. After graduation, I moved to Singapore and became a Software Engineer writing code for web and mobile products.</p>

<p>I spent 4 years at <a href="https://www.firstcodeacademy.com" target="_blank">First Code Academy</a>, a technology education company providing coding programs for kids aged 4 to 18 years old across Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. When I joined First Code, we had 5 people in Hong Kong and by the time I left my role as a COO, we had 35 full-time and about 50 part-time globally.</p>

<p>Recently, I was the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://toasty.ai" target="_blank">Toasty</a>, a video meeting platform that focuses on collaboration and engagement. We aspired to turn online meetings and gatherings from a dull, one-way interaction to a collaborative experience.</p>

<p>I am a generalist in business, that includes developing new markets, <strong>driving product growth (my current focus)</strong>, marketing and customer success, recruiting and training, automating processes etc.</p>

<p><strong>My life motto:</strong> Comfort is the Enemy of Growth.</p>

<p><strong>I enjoy:</strong> Humble & fair, develop people, drive sustainable growth, and nurture a learning-oriented culture</p>

<p><strong>Not my cup of tea:</strong> Too much ego, self-centeredness, lack of transparency,  manual processes, short-sighted</p>

<p>I speak regularly at schools, events, and conferences about business, education, technology and coding which <a href="/speaking">you can find out more here</a>. When I'm not working on something, I am likely to be reading on my Kindle, running or cycling outdoors, organizing Babson alumni events or entrepreneurial meetups, or embracing my role as a father and husband.</p>
