<h3>Technology / Education / Software Engineering</h3>
<h3>Kevon Cheung</h3>
<br>
<p>I was the COO and Co-founder of First Code Academy, an education and technology company providing tailored coding programs for kids aged 4 to 18 years old in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. First Code Academyâ€™s mission is to empower the next generation to become creators of technology.</p>

<p>My passion for technology started at the age of 14 when I was tinkering on the Internet and built a number of websites that attracted thousands of users. I attended Babson College in the United States to major in Entrepreneurship, which convinced me that to make an impact on the world, it requires taking lead and creating true values. Prior to First Code Academy, I was a Software Engineer in Singapore writing code for web and mobile products. I have a mix of business and technical background, and I focused on Operations, People Operations, and Software Engineering at First Code Academy.</p>

<p>I speak regularly at schools, events, and conferences about education, technology and coding which <a href="/speaking">you can find out more here</a>. When not in the office, I am likely to be reading a book, running or cycling outdoors, and playing with kids.</p>
