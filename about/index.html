<h3>Kevon Cheung</h3>
<h4>An entrepreneurial mind specialized in growing early-stage businesses</h4>
<br>
<p>My story isn't that long, but let me start by telling you something. A lot of people started their entrepreneurial journeys since young, perhaps by selling candies or instant noodles to schoolmates. For me, I was never an entrepreneurial kid. I was quite the opposite, I was the student who lived by boundaries. I couldn't recall when, but at some point in my life (most likely at Babson College), I became obsessed with the idea of creating businesses, bringing true values to people, and having an impact to the world.</p>

<p>My passion for technology started at the age of 14 when I was tinkering on the Internet and built a number of websites that attracted thousands of users. I attended Babson College in the United States to major in Entrepreneurship & Finance. Then I became a Software Engineer in Singapore writing code for web and mobile products.</p>

<p>I spent most of my early career at First Code Academy, a technology education company providing  coding programs for kids aged 4 to 18 years old across Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. When I joined First Code, we had 5 people in Hong Kong and by the time I left my active role, we had 35 full-time and about 50 part-time globally.</p>

<p>I have done pretty much everything you can think of in running a business, including developing new markets, recruiting and training, setting up operations, selling our classes, reviewing financial models, writing code and automating processes, mentoring team members etc. I was promoted to COO and was invited to become the co-founder of the company. All of this was because of my life motto: Comfort is the Enemy of Growth.</p>

<p>Having been on the management team, here is a little summary:<br>
I ENJOY: Be Humble & Be Fair, Develop People, Innovate with Technology, Build Sustainable System to Grow Business, Nurture Positive Company Culture<br>
NOT MY CUP OF TEA: Too Much Ego, Self-centeredness, Lack of Transparency & Communication, Absence of Automation, Short-sighted</p>

<p>I speak regularly at schools, events, and conferences about business, education, technology and coding which <a href="/speaking">you can find out more here</a>. When I'm not working on something, I am likely to be reading a book, running or cycling outdoors, organizing alumni events with Babson, or playing with kids.</p>
