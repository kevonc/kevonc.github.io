<h2>Hey, I'm Kevon Cheung!</h2>

<h4>--- In A Nutshell</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Grew up & based in Hong Kong. Spent 7 years in Boston</li>
	<li>Proud new dad with a baby girl</li>
	<li>Co-founder and ex-CEO of video collab platform <a href="https://toasty.ai/" target="_blank">Toasty</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>--- All About Venture Building</h4>

<p>My love for creating software started when I was 12. I built a number of websites that attracted hundreds of thousands of users. Ever since then, I've been starting and advising tech projects.</p>

<p>I startd my career as a Software Engineer in Singapore. Then I spent 4 years at <a href="https://www.firstcodeacademy.com" target="_blank">First Code Academy</a>, a leading technology education company offering coding programs for kids aged 4 to 18 years old across Asia. When I joined First Code, we had 5 people in Hong Kong and by the time I left my role as COO, we had scaled to 4 countries with 35 full-time and 50 part-time.</p>

<p>Recently, I was the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://toasty.ai" target="_blank">Toasty</a>, a video collaboration platform making video meetings and gatherings more interactive.</p>

<p>I am a generalist in venture building, and my strengths are developing new markets, <strong>driving software product growth (my current focus)</strong>, building systems in marketing and customer success, and recruiting & training.</p>

<h4>--- What I Value</h4>

<p><strong>📚 Enabling:</strong> learning potentials for adults or kids</p>

<p><strong>🔨 Enabling:</strong> building and efficiency</p>

<p><strong>🎥 Enabling:</strong> expression through video</p>

<p><strong>⭐ My life motto:</strong> "Comfort is the enemy of growth." It is even framed on my wall!</p>

<p><strong>👍 I enjoy:</strong> Be humble & respect everyone, develop people, focus on long-term sustainable growth, and nurture a learning-oriented culture</p>

<p><strong>👎 Not my cup of tea:</strong> Have too much ego, self-centered, lack of transparency, short-sighted in growth</p>

<p><strong>🌳 When I'm not building:</strong> you can find me spending time with my family, reading on Kindle, running or cycling outdoors, or looking at trees with yoga music.</p>

<h4>--- Weird About Me</h4>

<p>👕 I like to wear plain t-shirts or shirts to reduce decision fatigue.</p>

<p>🥑 I like chicken breast and the raw taste of food.</p>

<p>🏠 I like everything household, including cleaning dishes and tidying.</p>
