<p>Kevon's passion for technology started at the age of 14 when he was tinkering on the Internet and built a number of websites that attracted thousands of users. He later attended Babson College in the United States to major in Entrepreneurship, which convinced him that to make an impact on the world, it requires taking lead and creating true values. Prior to First Code Academy, Kevon was a Software Engineer in Singapore writing code for web and mobile products. With his mix of business and technical background, he now focuses on Operations, People Operations, and Software Engineering at First Code Academy.</p>
