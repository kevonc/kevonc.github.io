<h2>Who</h2>
<p>When I was studying high school in Massachusetts and looking back to what I did over the last few years (it was 2005 and I was about 14-15 years old), I thought I was an abnormal kid wasting all my after-school time on building webpages, buying domains, configuring web hosting, and following the latest php frameworks. Fast forward to today, technology and software become the fuel to drive our world to improvement. Suddenly, it was not so bad.</p>

<p>My name is Kevon Cheung. Since I graduated from <a herf="http://www.babson.edu/" target="_blank">Babson College</a>, an entrepreneurship school. I've been in a space I'm passionate about; first I was trying to run a startup, then I was working as a Software Engineer in Singapore, and now I'm with <a href="http://firstcodeacademy.com" target="_blank">First Code Academy</a>, empowering the next generation to become creators of technology. I only do what I enjoy and I'm fortunate enough to be working on things I care about.</p>

<h2>Why</h2>
<p>What I love about technology is the possibilities and flexibilities. You can code and create alone, or you can collaborate with others. Anything is based on your own choice. It is also extremely mobile; you can be productive anytime anywhere. When I was young, I thought architect was cool. Now I think architect in the online world is cooler.</p>

<h2>How</h2>
<p>To be honest, it was purely determination. You have 24 hours a day, you spend 8 hours at work, and you spend 8 hours sleeping. The remaining 8 hours determine what kind of life you live. I believe in this, truly.</p>
