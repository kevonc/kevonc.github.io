From my own definition, I'm still really, really far from success. Although I'm not a 4.0 student, I do have high expectations of life achievements for myself and I believe I can make it one day. The question now is how? How do you take baby steps towards your own success? For me, the answer is knowing yourself inside out to maximize your growth, then be patient and seek opportunities at the right time.






finance -> startup - wanna see what this trend is all about, wanna say i'm an entrepreneur, wanna find out what a real business is made of

startup -> coding - want to build products, resemble with my own passion, want to get my hands dirty

coding -> business development of an academy - knowing to code is the most important skill in today's world, no doubt about it, but knowing how to run a startup is equally important, the mentality, the grind, the approach, how to build a team, how to talk, the small details here and there

every decision i make, i clearly know what i want to get out of. the essential part of all of these is, you have to truly love what you're doing and learning, and pour your heart into it, then everyday the lessons just come to you. ask questions often and seek advice from people who have done it before you.

How to find yourself? Look at what you spend most time on when you were a kid.
Look at what you spend most time on your weekend now.

the 8 hours (other than sleeping and working) defines who you are, did you watch TV or read books? Did you go on Youtube or take an online course? Did you get drunk and spend a day being hangover or hang out with friends who relax your mind and inspire you to go further?

if you ask me, what I want to do next? I have no answer for you because I have no plans yet, but I can tell you it will be about tech and education, because that is what I have experience in. Do what you're good at.

A lot of people are seeking programmers to help them build out their apps, I can tell you, if you understand zero code, you'll not get very far. In history, people often become successful because they are specialized in what they're good or familiar at.
