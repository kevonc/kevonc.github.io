Always set goals, and always measure them. Here is a list of things I've done in the year of 2016.

### Reading

I managed to read 26 books this year, that's exactly 1 book every 2 weeks. I was hoping I could read more but there were too many things to work on at <a href="http://firstcodeacademy.com" target="_blank">First Code Academy</a>. My secret is carrying my Kindle everywhere with me when I know I will be waiting, flying, or having no Internet. I did not really have a theme for the year, I would say towards the end of the year, it became more focused on Leadership and Personal Growth.

<ul>
	<li>Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future</li>
	<li>Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time</li>
	<li>How I Lost 170 Million Dollars: My Time as #30 at Facebook</li>
	<li>Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore: A Novel</li>
	<li>When Breath Becomes Air</li>

	<li>High Output Management - yet to finish</li>

</ul>


### Traveling

Compared with a lot of jetsetters out there, I don't think the list is even worth sharing. Anyway, I would like to travel more with purpose, say running an oversea half marathon.

<ul>
	<li>Cape Town & Johannesburg, South Africa</li>
	<li>Bangkok, Thailand</li>
	<li>Bangkok, Thailand</li>
	<li>Rhode Island and Maine, USA</li>
	<li>Phuket, Thailand</li>
	<li>San Francisco, USA</li>
	<li>Singapore</li>
	<li>Siem Reap, Cambodia</li>
	<li>Bali, Indonesia</li>
</ul>

### Blogging

Including this post, I wrote 5 blog posts this year, far from my initial plan to get 12 blog posts out the door. Definitely something to work on in 2017.

<ul>
	<li>7 Books to Read in 2016</li>
	<li>7 Life Mottos I Live By</li>
	<li>How We Define Our Company Culture at First Code Academy</li>
	<li>You Have Been Finding Jobs The Wrong Way</li>
	<li>2016 Year in Review</li>
</ul>

### Public Speaking

I set myself a goal to take on a challenge of speaking in the public this year. It just so happened that WHub was hosting an event about "working at startup" and they invited me to be a panelist. It was my first ever public speaking gig and I was excited to share my startup experience with the audience.

### Running

After my 1st half marathon in 2014 in Singapore, I told myself that the next one would not be coming soon. 2 years later, I figured I needed some new challenges in my life, and so instead of joining another half marathon, I joined 2. With a training plan in mind, I ran regularly throughout the year and achieved a personal best of 2h4m at Angkor Wat Half Marathon, 4m behind my target yet still a major improvement. I'm thinking to sign up more half marathons in 2017, anyone?

<ul>
	<li>HKDRC Half Marathon - 2016 Oct</li>
	<li>Angkor Wat Half Marathon - 2016 Dec</li>
</ul>
