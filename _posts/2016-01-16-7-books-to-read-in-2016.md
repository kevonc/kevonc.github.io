Year 2016 is the first year I am drafting up a detailed annual plan for myself. After reading Chris Guillebeau's <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/how-to-conduct-your-own-annual-review/" target="_blank">"How to Conduct Your Own Annual Review"</a>, I came up with 14 measureable targets in the fields of Relationship (Family & Friends), Finance, Health, Learning, and Travel. I didn't set a target for reading books because it is a no brainer for me that I must and will read a lot. It is funny because I hated reading in my childhood, and now I treat books as one of my closest friends, so I spent some time making a list of books I will read in 2016. I hope you'll find some of them interesting, and please also share with me what you're reading!

###1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015EL0QRG?keywords=Thing%20Explainer%3A%20Complicated%20Stuff%20in%20Simple%20Word&qid=1452948442&ref_=sr_1_1&s=digital-text&sr=1-1" target="_blank">Thing Explainer: Complicated Stuff in Simple Words</a>
By Randall Munroe

<strong>Why?</strong> Heard that the author only uses the 1,000 most common words in the English language to explain various subjects. Perfect for someone like me who doesn't have a large library of vocabularies but still have the curiosity to explore new topics!

###2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mindset-The-New-Psychology-Success/dp/0345472322" target="_blank">Mindset: The New Psychology of Success</a>
By Carol Dweck

<strong>Why?</strong> From my last blog post, I talked about success, and I do believe mindset is one of the keys to success.
<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> Hmmm, I would not recommend this book at all, I stopped reading because of 2 main reasons.
<br>
1) After reading around different chapters, it seems to only talk about one message - why you should have a growth mindset, not a fixed mindset. Using a lot of small stories to bring out the same message, the book does feel like an infinite loop.
<br>
2) And the stories are not even interesting ......

By Sydney Finkelstein

<strong>Why?</strong> A new book without any review yet, but leadership book is always a good one.

By Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky, Braden Kowitz

<strong>Why?</strong> Sprint is a popular concept in the startup space yet no one really knows how it works; I'm curious to find out more about how to build products faster.

###5. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nonsense-The-Power-Not-Knowing-ebook/dp/B00SEF112Y" target="_blank">Nonsense: The Power of Not Knowing</a>
By Jamie Holmes

<strong>Why?</strong> I'm quite intrigued by the ambiguity of many things, maybe it is better staying this way.

By Hendrie Weisinger, J. P. Pawliw-Fry

<strong>Why?</strong> Some people say they cannot deal with pressure, yet some people like Cristiano Ronaldo (famous footballer) said he loves the pressure of the game. I just want to do my best.

<strong>Why?</strong> A close one of mine passed away from lung cancer 16 years ago. What does it feel like when you're so close to death? I want to find out.
