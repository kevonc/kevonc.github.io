Lately I have been working on an internal project at Favorite Medium that uses Angular JS for web interface and Rails for API. I use this stack because I was desperate to learn Angular JS, and I prove my desire right by liking Angular JS a lot. I encountered one issue regarding how Angular and Rails interpret time differently based on timezone and it reverts any date I input in the form by a day. This is how I solve it.

In the app, there are multiple date fields, here let's say Date of Birth. The user inputs his DOB on a form and sends a request to the Rails API to update the record, straight forward enough. The problem I was having was a time difference issue: when a user inputs March 1st, 1990 as his DOB, Angular interprets it as 1990-03-01 00:00 along with your time zone of +08 00. The date reaches Rails and because it is using UTC, it flips the time 8 hours back so that the datetime is now 1990-02-28 16:00, and if your database column is Date, it will save as 1990-02-28, missing one day! It was quite an annoying issue because I do not care about the time zone difference, I simply want to state a correct date.

Coming to the conclusion, I decided to modify the datetime on client side to make up for the timezone difference. I wrote a Date service with a function to add the timezone offset.

	addTimezoneDiff: function (object) {
		var timeDiff = Math.abs(new Date().getTimezoneOffset());
		angular.forEach(object, function(value, key) {
			if (value !== null && typeof value.getMonth === 'function') {
				object[key] = new Date(value * 1 + (1000 * 60 * timeDiff));
			}
		});
		return object;
	}

Basically what it does is instead of passing 1990-03-01 00:00, it passes 1990-03-01 08:00 to Rails and Rails will fix it by flipping it back to 1990-03-01 00:00. To be honest, I do not like this approach and I beleive there is a better way. I am happy to take any advice if any of you stumble upon my post; in the meanwhile, this works for me.
